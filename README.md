<h1>Lion Engine</h1>
<section>
    This is a 2D game engine made in C++ for my personal use. The project is being developed in my spare time to improve my skills as a software engineer. I combined its architecture with Judson Santiago's game engine, Yan Chernikov's game engine, and of course, my preference.
