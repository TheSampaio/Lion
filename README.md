<h1>Owl Engine</h1>
<section>
    This is a cross-platform 3D game engine made in C++ that uses OpenGL to draw on screen. The project is still in progress and because of this does not represent the final result and may contain some bugs depending on your OS or hardware. I plan to add support for Vulkan in the future, but only after all the basic features are ready.

<h2>Credits</h2>
<section>
    The game engine is being developed following the classes of <a href="https://github.com/JudsonSS">Judson Santiago</a> (Master in Computer Science from the Federal Rural University of the Semiarid (UFERSA)) on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JudSan">YouTube</a>. The entire architecture of the game engine was planned by him, because of that all the credits are his. The original project was developed using Direct3D as the graphics API, so you can follow the original project <a href="https://github.com/JudsonSS/Jogos">here</a> if you don't know much about OpenGL or prefer Direct3D as the graphics API.
